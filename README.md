<h1 align="center">Basic Discord Bot Base in Typescript</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

- Uhh idk tbh its just a normal base ðŸ¤·

* Also there might be some errors but it works, notably the <>.name does not exist on `ApplicationCommandDataResolvable` :p. If you fix it, make a PR :D

<h2>How To Use</h2>

_This Project was built upon the `pnpm` package manager for npm, but you are free to use your own_

**|>** Rename the `.env.example` to `.env`

**|>** Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` and `npm start`.
