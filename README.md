<h1 align="center">Basic Discord Bot Base in Typescript</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

- Uhh idk tbh its just a normal base ðŸ¤·

* Also there might be some errors but it works, notably the <>.name does not exist on `ApplicationCommandDataResolvable` :p. If you fix it, make a PR :D

<h2>How To Use</h2>

_This Project was built upon the `pnpm` package manager for npm, but you are free to use your own_

**|>** Rename the `.env.example` to `.env`

**|>** Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` and `npm start`.

<h2>TODO:</h2>

_Bear in mind this base is still in development so it will take time before all the necessary features are added._

- Select Menus

- Context Menus

- Autocomplete support

<h3>How to use?</h3>

> So I'll give a proper guide on how to use it l8r but for now clone the repo, compile it run it.

> The args in buttons, select menus & modals are separated by `-`. So the args in `testing_btn-5-hi` would be `["5","hi"]`
